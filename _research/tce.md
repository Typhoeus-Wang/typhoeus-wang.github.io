description: >
  Manifold Learning (ML) algorithms -- also called Embedding algorithms -- can help us 
  interpret data with many dimensions (such as a cloud of word embeddings or of 
  configurations of a molecule) by mapping it to 2D or to 3D where we can see it.

For my personal site I've toned it down a bit. Instead of a flashy sidebar image, I chose a solid background color.
However, I've given [certain](https://qwtel.com/projects/ducky-hunting/) [pages](https://qwtel.com/projects/blocky-blocks/) big sidebar images, and let Hydejack blend back to normal when the user navigates away.

While I love the font used for Hydejack's headings, for my personal site I felt less of a need to control the typesetting.
That's why I'm not using Google Fonts, and instead use whatever is the default for the reader's operating system.

```yml
google_fonts: false
font:         false
font_heading: false
font_code:    false
```

The configuration I use to enable the system font on my site. Feel free to copy!
