    summary: "Extracting the speech of participants in a conversation amidst interfering speakers and noise presents a challenging problem. 
    In this paper, we introduce the novel task of target conversation extraction, where the goal is to extract the audio of a target conversation 
    based on the speaker embedding of one of its participants. To accomplish this, we propose leveraging temporal patterns inherent in human conversations, 
    particularly turn-taking dynamics, which uniquely characterize speakers engaged in conversation and distinguish them from interfering speakers and noise."
