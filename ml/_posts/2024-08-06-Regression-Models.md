## What is Regression?

Regression is a statistical approach used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable (target variable) and one or more independent variables (predictor variables). The objective is to determine the most suitable function that characterizes the connection between these variables.

It seeks to find the best-fitting model, which can be utilized to make **predictions** or draw **conclusions**.

It is a supervised machine learning technique, used to predict the value of the dependent variable for new, unseen data. It models the relationship between the input features and the target variable, allowing for the estimation or prediction of numerical values.
