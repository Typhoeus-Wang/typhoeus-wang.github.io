Welcome to my site!


## Introduction

In my undergraduate study at UW, I'm fortunate to be advised by Shyam Gollakota. My main reseasrch interests include
speech/audio processing (end-to-end speech translation, source separation, speech representation learning), self-supervised learning, 
NLP especially LLM, as well as recommendation system.

Start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading.flip-title}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:

* [Install]{:.heading.flip-title} --- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.
{:.related-posts.faded}

After you've familiarized yourself with Hydejack, you can delete the following folders and files
containing example content:

~~~
├── _featured_categories
│   └── example.md
├── _projects
│   └── *
├── docs
├── example
├── licenses
├── assets
│   └── img
│       ├── blog
│       ├── docs
│       └── projects
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── forms-by-example.md
├── LICENSE.md
└── NOTICE.md
~~~

[install]: docs/install.md
