Welcome to my site!

## Introduction

In my undergraduate study at UW, I'm fortunate to be advised by Shyam Gollakota. I'm currently working at Mobile Intelligence Lab at University of Washington, Seattle, with a focus on Human-computer Interaction and Speech Processing and I also work as a machine learning engineer at NetUp to build recommendation system. My main reseasrch interests include human-computer interaction
speech/audio processing (end-to-end speech translation, source separation, speech representation learning), NLP, as well as recommendation system.
