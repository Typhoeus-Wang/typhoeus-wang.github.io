Welcome to my site!

## Introduction

In my undergraduate study at UW, I'm fortunate to be advised by Shyam Gollakota. I'm currently working at Intelligent System Lab at University of Washington, Seattle, with a focus on speech processing and I also work as a machine learning engineer at NetUp to build recommendation system. My main reseasrch interests include
speech/audio processing (end-to-end speech translation, source separation, speech representation learning), self-supervised learning, NLP especially LLM, as well as recommendation system.
